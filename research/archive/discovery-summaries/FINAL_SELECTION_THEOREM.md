## Theorem (computer-assisted, COMPLETE core)

Let Safe(S) mean the occupied set S on the n×n grid contains no forbidden
4-subset (collinear or concyclic; integer det test). Let K_n be the maximum
|S| with Safe(S). Then **K_7 = 14** (inherited; re-counted 16 times).

Let \(\mathcal{M}_7\) be the family of safe 14-sets on 7×7. Then:

1. \(|\mathcal{M}_7| = 16\), in two D4-orbits of size 8 (COMPLETE enum).

2. **Occupancy selection.** Order the ten D4 cell-orbits
   `(0,0)(0,1)(0,2)(0,3)(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(2,2)(2,3)(3,3)`.
   Exactly two occupancy vectors occur:
   - **A** = (2,3,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,1) — center occupied, corners=2
   - **B** = (3,1,2,1,1,3,1,0,2,0) — no center, corners=3, uses both (0,3) and (2,3)
   Corner count at K=14 is **only** 2 or 3 (corners=4 → 0 COMPLETE; corners=1 census 0).

3. **Phase characterization (COMPLETE counts).**
   - \(\mathcal{M}_A = \{S : \#\text{corners}=2,\ (3,3)\in S\}\), \(|\mathcal{M}_A|=8\) COMPLETE.
     Equivalently: corners=2 ∧ forbid(0,3) → 8; corners=2 ∧ forbid(2,3) → 8.
   - \(\mathcal{M}_B = \{S : \#\text{corners}=3,\ (3,3)\notin S\}\), \(|\mathcal{M}_B|=8\) COMPLETE.
     Further, every such S uses both (0,3) and (2,3) (require each → 8 COMPLETE)
     and every mandatory orbit (require each → 8 COMPLETE).
   - forbid center∪(2,2) @14 → 8 COMPLETE (=B).
   - forbid B∪(2,2) @14 → 8 COMPLETE (=A).
   - center ∧ (0,3) or (2,3) or (2,2) @14 = 0 COMPLETE.
   - no-center ∧ forbid(0,3)∧forbid(2,3) @14 = 0 COMPLETE.
   - A cannot require (0,3)/(2,3)/(2,2) — all **0 COMPLETE**.
   - A ∧ forbid (0,3) alone → 8 COMPLETE; A ∧ forbid (2,3) alone → 8 COMPLETE.
   - B cannot require center or (2,2) (COMPLETE 0).
   - B **cannot omit** (0,3) or (2,3) (forbid → 0 COMPLETE).
   - B **must** use both (0,3) and (2,3) (each require → 8 COMPLETE; global require census 8).
   - Every B uses all six mandatory orbits (require each → 8 COMPLETE).
   - Global forbid (0,3) or (2,3) @14 → 8 COMPLETE (=A).

4. **Mandatory / forbidden orbits (COMPLETE forbid-orbit).**
   Every S∈ℳ7 meets orbits `(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)` @14.
   No S uses orbit `(2,2)`.
   Phase-level COMPLETE zeros: **neither** A nor B may omit **any** of
   `(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)`.
   Global COMPLETE zeros @14 hold for **all six** mandatory orbits
   `(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)` (forbid → count=0).
   Census also has require(each mandatory orbit)=16/16; DFS require (0,2)
   reached 15/16 incomplete at 8M nodes.
   Deeper: `(0,2)` **and** `(1,2)` are already mandatory at **size 13** COMPLETE.

5. **Capacity decomposition (COMPLETE).** Let M be the six mandatory orbits.
   - max Safe on M only = **13**
   - max on M∪{center} = **14** (= phase A)
   - max on M∪{(0,3)} only = **13**; on M∪{(2,3)} only = **13**
   - max on M∪{(0,3),(2,3)} = **14** (= phase B; both orbits required)
   - max with any (2,2) occupied = **13**
   - center+(2,3) = **12**; forbid(0,2) = **12**; corners=4 ≤ **12**
   - **Cores (Cycle 27):** A-core = A0\\center (13 safe) extends to A0;
     B-core = B0\\B-bundle (11 safe) extends to B0; A-core∪B-bundle unsafe;
     B-core∪center unsafe — e.g. quad **{(3,3),(6,4),(2,6),(6,6)}**;
     A-core+(0,3) fires {(0,0),(1,0),(2,1),(0,3)}.

6. **Exchange / pinning (COMPLETE on the 16).**
   - Unique D4-class of 5→5 exchange A↔B; d*=5; no 1-swap; no pair with d≤4.
   - min_det(S)=2 for every S∈ℳ7 (two stones determine S among ℳ7).
   - All 224 thirteen-subsets of members of ℳ7 uniquely complete inside ℳ7
     → single-stone paths between distinct max sets visit size ≤12.

7. **Corridor (COMPLETE on union / path-witness).**
   On min A–B pair (symdiff 10 = unique 5→5 exchange; union **19** cells):
   restricted widest single-stone path has width **11** COMPLETE
   (`../../log/discovery-cycles/CYCLE39C_WIDEST_PATH_FAST.md`; 59 quads inside union; bottleneck
   states never use (2,2) — not in the union — and use center in only
   ~30% of width-11 bottlenecks). Safe 14-sets on the union itself are
   still {A,B}-type only. Explicit full-board A–B path dips to 12.

## Geometric root (Cycles 30–32) — partial first principles

**Orbit–circle lemma (COMPLETE, all n).** The board center for D4 is
\(((n-1)/2,(n-1)/2)\). D4 preserves radius from that point, so **every
D4-orbit lies on one circle centered at the board center**. Any 4 points
on a circle are concyclic ⇒ forbidden ⇒ **occupancy ≤ 3** on every orbit
with ≥4 cells. This holds for odd *and* even n (`CYCLE31B`).

| n | #orbits | #≥4 all-concyclic | naive Σceil(≥4) | known K_n |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 5 | 6 | 5 | 15 | 9 |
| 6 | 6 | 6 | 18 | 11 |
| 7 | 10 | 9 | 27 | **14** |
| 8 | 10 | 10 | 30 | 15 |

Local ceilings alone do **not** single out n=7. What is special on n=7 is
the **cross-shell interference pattern** on a ten-orbit radial
stratification, measured by COMPLETE constrained capacities on the
mandatory skeleton M (`CYCLE30B/C`):

- α(M)=13=2n−1 despite Σceil(M)=18 (deficit **5** from multi-orbit quads).
- Most pairs/triples of M-orbits **hit** local ceilings (max=6 or 9).
- Every 4-subset of M already has COMPLETE max ≤12 (deficits 0–3); only
  the full six-orbit skeleton realizes 13, and only exclusive phase
  extensions (center or full B-bundle) lift to 14.

**COMPLETE occupancy-lattice certificate for α(M)=13 (`CYCLE34`,`CYCLE40`).**
Order M-orbits `(0,0)(0,1)(0,2)(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)`. The orbit–circle lemma
forces o_i≤3. There are exactly **120** vectors with Σ o_i=14 and o_i≤3.
Exact-orbit decision search on M (COMPLETE) shows **none** is realizable.

**Compressed form (Cycle 40):** COMPLETE **proper-subset** solver maxima
(pairs/triples/4-/5-orbits; not the circular full-M bound) already kill
**113/120**. The remaining **7** residual vectors each satisfy every
proper-subset maximum yet are COMPLETE-unrealizable (joint lemmas).
Hence local ceilings + proper-subset capacities + 7 named exceptions
imply α(M)≤13. Known sum-13 patterns are realizable (controls).

Do not use “known max-13 pattern” bounds as universal inequalities
without a solver COMPLETE max on that subset (rejected: e.g. pair
(1,1)+(1,3) max is 5, not 3).

**COMPLETE phase-lift occupancy decision (`CYCLE35`).** Exact-occupancy
search on the extended orbit sets:

| configuration | Σocc | realizable? |
|---|---:|---|
| A phase (M-occ + center=1) | 14 | **yes** |
| B phase (M-occ + (0,3)=1,(2,3)=2) | 14 | **yes** |
| A + partial B | 15 | **no** COMPLETE |
| B + center | 15 | **no** COMPLETE |
| A + full B | 17 | **no** COMPLETE |

So the exclusive phase lift is itself an occupancy-lattice fact, not only
a max-size census. n=7 has the **lowest** K/Σceil among n=5,6,7
(14/27≈0.52 vs 9/15=0.60, 11/18≈0.61) — cross-shell interference is
tightest where the crystal appears.

Cross-shell (multi-orbit) quads as a fraction of all forbidden quads:
n=7 has **96.6%** multi-orbit quads (`CYCLE32`).

This is a **near-complete** first-principles explanation of the skeleton
peak: the local ceiling is geometric and universal; the n=7 crystal is
the COMPLETE statement that only this board’s shell lattice supports a
2n maximum via two exclusive extensions of a 2n−1 skeleton. A residual
gap remains for deriving the *phase lift* 13→14 and K_n=2n for other n
purely from geometry without constrained solves.

---

## What is *not* claimed

- A full first-principles derivation of K_7=2n from board geometry alone
  (skeleton peak is certified; phase lift + cross-n still use solver).
- That orbit-quad density explains the crystal (**rejected**: n=6 has higher
  (0,2)/(1,2) incidence yet diffuse maxima).
- That a unique center cell produces phases (**rejected**: n=5 center split
  44/56 COMPLETE without crystal collapse).
- That concyclicity of orbits alone explains n=7 (**rejected**: universal
  for all n by the orbit–circle lemma).
- Complete n=8 classification (**SAMPLE** only: flexible orbits, d=4 pairs).
- K_9 or full σ_7.

## Branch status (research, not pushed)

## Sharp contrasts (COMPLETE censuses)

| n | K_n | #max | mandatory orbits | empty orbit @max | occ vectors | min_det min |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 4 | 7=2n−1 | 64 | 3/3 | none | 4 | 3–4 |
| 5 | 9=2n−1 | 100 | 4 | none | 9 | 3 |
| 6 | 11=2n−1 | 464 | 4 | none | 22 | 3 |
| 7 | **14=2n** | **16** | **6** | **(2,2)** | **2** | **2** |

Omit-cost at each board’s own maximum (COMPLETE max probes):

| omitted | n=5 | n=6 | n=7 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| center/(2,2) | 0 (still K=9) | 0 (still K=11 without (2,2)) | forbidden @14 |
| (0,2) | −1 | −1 | **−2** |
| (1,2) | −1 | −1 | **−2** (with (0,2): −3) |

n=6 independent: 296/464 sets have a d=1 partner (304 undirected pairs).
n=8 SAMPLE: (2,2) usable; center-block usable; 67–45 occ patterns in capped dumps.

## One-sentence summary

> On 7×7 the +1 maximum family is a **two-phase crystal**: a six-orbit
> mandatory skeleton that only reaches 2n−1=13 is lifted to 2n=14 solely by
> a **mutually exclusive** commitment to the center (phase A: corners=2) or
> to the full (0,3)+(2,3) bundle (phase B: corners=3, no center), never by
> (2,2); the phases meet only through a unique 5→5 exchange and are locally
> pinned by 2-stones yet globally isolated — a selection pattern that fails
> on n=4,5,6 censuses and in n=8 samples.
