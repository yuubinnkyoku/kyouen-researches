# Cycle 5 — Exact Grundy (nimber) structure on n ≤ 6

## Checked

- branch: `replicate-8x8-o-stratum` @ `db50e40`
- New exact enumerator: `night-research/grundy_cycle5.cpp` (C++, iterative DFS + memo)
- Python reference: `night-research/grundy_cycle5.py` (n ≤ 5 cross-check, mex consistency 0 violations)
- Deep-dive: `night-research/analyze_cycle5_grundy.py` → `cycle5-grundy-deepdive.json`
- n = 6 evaluated with cap at 14 stones; the enumerated reachable set ends at
  k = 11, so the n = 6 table below is exact for all reachable positions (the
  cap layer never materialized).

## Headline exact results

Empty-board Grundy numbers reproduce the known winner table (g = 0 ⇔ S-win):

| n | winner | empty g | max nimber | nimbers seen | missing ≤ max |
|--:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|
| 2 | F | 1 | 1 | {0,1} | none |
| 3 | F | 1 | 1 | {0,1} | none |
| 4 | S | 0 | 5 | {0..5} | none |
| 5 | F | 1 | 6 | {0..6} | none |
| 6 | F | 1 | 8 | {0..8} | none |

Consistency: mex condition re-verified on every enumerated position
(Python: 0 violations on n=2,3,4; C++ histograms match Python exactly).

## F1. n = 2, 3 are the only "tame" boards: nimbers ⊆ {0,1}

On n = 2 and n = 3 every reachable safe position has Grundy number 0 or 1,
and g = 0 iff popcount is odd. This is exactly the Cycle-4 parity locking
restated in nimber form: **parity locking ⇔ nimbers ⊆ {0,1}**. From n = 4
on, nimbers escape {0,1}.

## F2. n = 5 losing first moves all have Grundy number exactly 3

The k = 1 layer of n = 5 splits as

| first-move orbit | size | g | first-move result |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| (0,0) corner | 4 | 3 | LOSS |
| (1,0) edge non-center | 8 | 3 | LOSS |
| (2,1) interior axial | 4 | 3 | LOSS |
| (2,0) edge center | 4 | 0 | WIN |
| (1,1) interior diagonal | 4 | 0 | WIN |
| (2,2) center | 1 | 0 | WIN |

So on 5×5, **the first move is losing iff the resulting 1-stone position has
Grundy number exactly 3** — a single uniform nimber, not just "nonzero".
This sharpens the Cycle-4 finding (winning iff zero winning replies): all 16
losing first moves are equivalent to the same nim-heap *3*.

Child-nimber histograms of the three losing orbits show why mex = 3:

| orbit | child g=0 | g=1 | g=2 | replies |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| (0,0) | 4 | 14 | 6 | 24 |
| (1,0) | 2 | 18 | 4 | 24 |
| (2,1) | 2 | 12 | 10 | 24 |

Each covers {0,1,2} and never produces a child with g ≥ 3, so mex = 3.



## F3. n = 4, k = 2: g = 1 and g = 4 are completely absent from a 120-position layer

The 120 safe 2-stone positions of 4×4 have nimber histogram
`{0: 84, 2: 20, 3: 8, 5: 8}` — **g = 1 and g = 4 never occur**, even though
both occur at other layers of the same board. The 36 non-zero positions form
6 D4 orbits, each with a uniform nimber:

| example pair | orbit size | g |
|---|--:|--:|
| (0,0)-(2,0) | 8 | 5 |
| (1,0)-(3,1) | 8 | 3 |
| (1,0)-(1,2) | 8 | 2 |
| (1,0)-(1,3) | 4 | 2 |
| (1,0)-(3,2) | 4 | 2 |
| (0,0)-(2,2) | 4 | 2 |

Orbit-uniformity is expected (D4 is a game automorphism), but the *absence*
of g = 1 from an entire layer is a genuine mex-gap phenomenon: no 2-stone
4×4 position is equivalent to a nim-heap of size 1.

## F4 (upgraded to theorem). Grundy ceiling and early saturation

Let $K_n$ be the maximal safe-set size on the n×n board and

$$M_n(k)=\max_{|S|=k} g(S)$$

the maximum Grundy number over reachable safe k-stone positions. Every child
of a k-stone position lies in layer k+1, and if $g(S)=m$ then mex requires a
child with value $m-1$; hence

$$M_n(k)\le M_n(k+1)+1.$$

Since $M_n(K_n)=0$ at the terminal layer, induction gives the universal
**Grundy ceiling**

$$\boxed{\,M_n(k)\le K_n-k\,}$$

and the ceiling deficit $D_n(k)=K_n-k-M_n(k)\ge0$ satisfies
$D_n(k)\ge D_n(k+1)$: deficits never shrink with depth, and **once the
ceiling is attained ($D_n(k)=0$), it is attained at every later layer**.
Moreover, if a k-stone position $S$ attains the ceiling, $g(S)=K_n-k=m$,
then mex forces its legal children to carry *exactly* the consecutive nimber
set $\{0,1,\dots,m-1\}$ (none can exceed $m-1$ by the ceiling), so a
**saturation chain** $m\to m-1\to\cdots\to1\to0$ runs from $S$ all the way
to a terminal position.

The measured max-nimber profiles

| n | K | k=1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 4 | 7 | 1 | **5** | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | | | | |
| 5 | 9 | 3 | 2 | **6** | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | | |
| 6 | 11 | 0 | 3 | **8** | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |

are therefore **not** a coincidental "unit-slope decay": each bold entry is a
single equality $M_n(k)=K_n-k$, and every later entry is forced by the
theorem. The genuine experimental content is the **saturation onset**

$$\boxed{\;\sigma_4=2,\qquad \sigma_5=3,\qquad \sigma_6=3\;}$$

i.e. on 4×4 the ceiling is already attained with just 2 stones on the board,
and on 5×5 / 6×6 with 3 stones. The sequences $5,4,3,2,1,0$ etc. after the
peak carry no extra information.

On n = 6 the k = 1 layer is uniformly g = 0 (all 36 first moves win, matching
the known density-1 classification), and the k = 2 layer uses only g ∈ {1,3}
— again with gaps ({0,2} absent).

**Corollary (cheap n ≥ 7 test).** To extend the table one does *not* need the
full Grundy distribution: determine $K_n$, then search shallow layers for a
single position with $g(S)=K_n-|S|$. The first such layer is $\sigma_n$, and
$M_n(k)=K_n-k$ for all $k\ge\sigma_n$ follows without further computation.

**Verification on existing data** (`verify_saturation.py`,
`cycle6-saturation-verify.json`): full deficit profiles

| n | K | D(0) | D(1) | D(2) | D(3) | D(4..K) | σ |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|:--:|--:|
| 4 | 7 | 7 | 5 | **0** | 0 | all 0 | 2 |
| 5 | 9 | 8 | 5 | 5 | **0** | all 0 | 3 |
| 6 | 11 | 10 | 10 | 6 | **0** | all 0 | 3 |

Deficits are non-increasing on every board, and no layer after σ has a
positive deficit — the theorem's predictions hold on all three exact boards.

## F5. 6×6 maximum safe-set size is 11 (464 maximum sets)

The n = 6 enumeration terminated naturally at k = 11: no reachable safe
position with ≥ 12 stones exists, and there are 464 safe 11-stone sets.
Thus the **maximum** kyouen-free set size on 6×6 is exactly 11, with 464
maximum configurations.

This does **not** mean that every inclusion-maximal safe set has 11 stones.
A later exhaustive maximal-spectrum enumeration (F-U) found **349,596**
inclusion-maximal safe sets across sizes 6 through 11. The earlier wording
“all maximal safe sets have exactly 11 stones” was a maximum/maximal
terminology error and is superseded by F-U.

## New non-trivial facts (summary)

1. **Uniform losing nimber on 5×5**: every losing first move has Grundy
   number exactly 3 (16/16). A single nimber characterizes the losing
   first-move set.
2. **Layer nimber gaps**: on 4×4 the entire 120-position k = 2 layer omits
   g = 1 and g = 4; on 6×6 the k = 2 layer omits g = 0 and g = 2.
3. **Grundy ceiling theorem + early saturation**: universally
   $M_n(k)\le K_n-k$, the deficit $D_n(k)$ is non-increasing, and one
   equality $M_n(\sigma)=K_n-\sigma$ forces equality at every deeper layer
   (with a saturation chain of exact consecutive child nimbers
   $\{0,\dots,m-1\}$ at each ceiling position). The measured onsets are
   $\sigma_4=2$, $\sigma_5=\sigma_6=3$ — the ceiling is reached with only
   2–3 stones on the board.
4. **6×6 maximum safe-set size is 11**, with 464 maximum 11-stone sets.
   Inclusion-maximal sets are more numerous and occur at sizes 6–11 (F-U).
   The maximum safe-set sizes for n = 1..6 are
   $K_n = 1,3,5,7,9,11 = 2n-1$ — but **$K_7 = 14 > 13$ refutes
   $K_n = 2n-1$ at n = 7**, and **$K_8=15$**.

## F6 (corrected). Structural parity law of certificates — and a scan bug

The original "parity locked vs mixed" scan (`cert_parity_check.py`) was a
**misreading**. The certificate format forces, on *every* board, that each
certificate edge adds exactly one stone and flips the outcome
(WIN → single LOSS witness child; LOSS → all WIN children). Hence every
certificate node at stone count k satisfies

$$\text{outcome} = \text{root\_outcome} \oplus (k \bmod 2),$$

i.e. all certificates are structurally parity-locked, and the lock's
*direction* is exactly the root outcome (S-board: even k = LOSS; F-board:
even k = WIN). The scan labelled F-boards "mixed" only because it assumed
the S-board pattern.

After fixing the scan bug, the law is verified with **zero violations** on
all nine certificates (n=1: 2 nodes … n=9: 13,457,134 nodes;
`verify_parity_law.py`, `cycle6-parity-law-verify.json`). This is therefore
**not a game-theoretic finding** — it is a structural corollary of the
certificate format, as anticipated in the review.

Each certificate's deepest node was also independently re-verified safe
with our own integer geometry (0 forbidden quads inside):
n=7: 14 stones, n=8: 14 stones, n=9: 17 stones — making the certificate-K
values rigorously verified **lower bounds** on $K_n$
(certificate-K = 1,3,5,6,9,11,14,14,17; e.g. exact $K_4=7$ vs cert 6).

## F7. K_7 = 14 exactly — the K_n = 2n−1 conjecture is refuted

`maxsafeset.cpp` (branch-and-bound over the 4-uniform hypergraph of
forbidden quads, incremental conflict counters + candidate bitmask,
validated against the exact values K_4 = 7 (UNSAT@8), K_5 = 9 (UNSAT@10),
K_6 = 11 (UNSAT@12)) decides:

- **n = 7, target 14: SAT** (direct witness, 14 points listed below),
- **n = 7, target 15: UNSAT** (exhaustive proof, 8,509,396 nodes).

Together with the certificate lower bound:

$$\boxed{K_7 = 14}$$

and since $2 \cdot 7 - 1 = 13 < 14$, the conjecture $K_n = 2n-1$ — which held
exactly on n = 1..6 — is **refuted at n = 7**.

7×7 witness (14 stones, independently re-verified 0/6364 quads inside):

```
(0,0) (1,0) (5,0) (1,1) (2,1) (5,2) (6,2) (3,3)
(5,3) (0,4) (3,5) (4,5) (6,5) (0,6)
```

- **n = 8, target 15: SAT** — a 15-stone safe set exists on 8×8
  (148,269 nodes; witness below, independently re-verified 0/14,564 quads
  inside). So $K_8 \ge 15$ (cert gives ≥ 14).

8×8 witness (15 stones):

```
(0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (1,1) (7,1) (3,2) (7,2) (5,3)
(0,4) (2,5) (4,5) (5,6) (0,7) (4,7) (5,7)
```

- **n = 8, target 16: UNSAT** (exhaustive proof, 348,155,856 nodes) — so

$$\boxed{K_8 = 15}$$

  which happens to equal $2n-1$ at n = 8. The later prior-art audit gives
  $K_9=18=2n$, so the $2n-1$ pattern is broken at **n=7 and n=9** among
  n≤9.

- **Superseded status for n=9:** this local single-word solver cannot search
  81-cell boards, and the certificate itself only gives the lower bound
  $K_9\ge17$. However, the later related-work audit found the already-published
  value **$K_9=18$** (2018). Therefore “$K_9=17$ or $\ge18$” is **not an open
  project-level question**. A 128-bit search would only independently
  reproduce the known value, not decide an unknown one.

## Caveats and next steps

- n = 6 was computed with `max_stones = 14`; enumeration terminated at
  k = 11 so results are exact, but a no-cap rerun would be a cheap audit.
- n = 7 exact Grundy is plausibly feasible (n = 6 enumerated 5.1M reachable
  positions; expect ~10–100× for n = 7) — candidate for an overnight run.
- Open: does unit-slope decay `max_g(k) = peak − (k − peak_k)` hold on n = 7?
  Superseded by the ceiling theorem and the later exact maximum computation:
  **$K_7=14$** (F7). The remaining n=7 Grundy question is the saturation onset
  $\sigma_7$ — the first layer containing a position with
  $g(S)=K_7-|S|$. Everything deeper is then forced.
- Open: what determines the peak nimber / onset ($\sigma_4=2$,
  $\sigma_5=\sigma_6=3$)?
- Open: is the uniform losing-nimber phenomenon (F2) specific to n = 5?
  No other F-board n ≤ 9 has losing first moves, so the next test case is
  the smallest F-board n ≥ 11 that has any losing first move.
