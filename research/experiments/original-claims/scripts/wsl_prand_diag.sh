n=6 level widths: 1,36,630,7140,56414,301952,997796,1783296,1459292,438952,35316,464
n=7 is expected to be roughly 20-30x wider at the peak (49 points vs 36).

If each state costs:
  8 bytes  (u64 mask)
  8 bytes  (legal-move mask)
  ~16-40 bytes (bigint numerator, 2-5 limbs at 9 bytes each)
  ~16 bytes (overhead / sort padding)
then n=7's widest level at ~20M states costs 20e6 * ~64B = ~1.3 GB for the
numerators alone, plus ~0.3 GB for the masks. That fits in 19 GB.

The real killer is likely that enumerate_levels keeps ALL levels resident at
once (`std::vector<std::vector<u64>> levels` for every k), not just two.
n=7 total states ~ 1.0-1.5e8, so 8 bytes each is ~1.2 GB, plus a second
copy during sort/unique. Still should fit...
Unless the bigint is 4-6 limbs at peak and the per-level struct is padded.
