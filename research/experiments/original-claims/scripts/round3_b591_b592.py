"""round3_b591_b592.py — B591/B592 (round 3): extend the K_n-1 layer to n=8.

B591 [universal]  |S| = K_n - 1  =>  d_max(S) <= C  (absolute constant C)
B592 [existential] exists c>0 and a sequence of boards with d_max(S) >= c*n

Round 2 reached n=2..7 exactly (d_max max = 0,0,2,3,4,8).  The one-stone-deficient
layer of B_8 (K_8 = 15, so 14 stones) was never touched: the 14-subsets of a 64-point
board cannot be enumerated.  What CAN be done exactly:

  * d_max(S) = |S| - max_{M in mathcal(M_8)} |S & M|, and mathcal(M_8) = all safe
    15-subsets.  Hence for ANY subfamily W of mathcal(M_8):
        d_max(S) <= min_{M in W} |S \\ M|      (upper bound)
  * and a branch-and-bound that maximises |S & M| over ALL safe 15-subsets, run to
    completion, gives d_max(S) exactly.  Run with a node budget it still gives a
    *rigorous lower bound* d_max(S) >= |S| - best_overlap_found.

For B592 (an existence claim) rigorous LOWER bounds on d_max are exactly what is
needed, so an incomplete branch-and-bound is still a valid witness.  For B591
(a universal upper bound) only upper bounds count, and those come from witness pools.

Strategy here: (1) build a pool of safe 15-subsets of B_8 by randomised search,
(2) hill-climb 14-subsets to maximise the pool upper bound on d_max, (3) run the
exact branch-and-bound on the best candidates for a certified lower bound.

Integer arithmetic only.  Hard wall-clock budget; every partial result is still sound.
