# 10x10 corrected probe: exploratory score-direction check

## Status

Exploratory / post-hoc.  This is **not** a rescue of the original blind result.
The ascending direction below was proposed only after the corrected independent
`memo`-descending rule was observed to perform badly.

The original `b5172a4` success-C claim therefore remains withdrawn.

## Question

After isolating the memo table per candidate, the originally intended rule
(larger `memo` first) gave first-LOSS ranks

`9, 19, 20, 16, 15, 2, 9`

for the seven batch0 LOSS parents and was worse than the random median in all
seven parents.

That directional failure raises a separate question: does the bounded probe
contain useful information with the opposite sign?

For unresolved candidates every corrected probe has exactly 1,000,000 visited
nodes. Sorting `memo` ascending is therefore equivalent to sorting
`visited - memo` descending.  However, **the latter must not be interpreted as
a revisit/transposition count**; see the source-level correction below.

## Re-analysis without new solving

The already stored 140 independent probes were joined to the already stored
exact batch0 outcomes.  No solver was rerun.

| parent | LOSS children | memo-desc | memo-asc | outcome-aware asc | exact random median |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2,9,33 | 6 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 4,9,33 | 2 | 19 | 1 | 1 | 6 |
| 9,12,33 | 1 | 20 | 1 | 1 | 10 |
| 9,19,33 | 1 | 16 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 9,23,33 | 2 | 15 | 5 | 5 | 6 |
| 0,31,36 | 15 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| 0,36,44 | 4 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 3 |

`outcome-aware asc` means:

1. a child proved LOSS inside the bounded probe goes first;
2. unresolved (`PROBE`) children are ordered by smaller memo first;
3. a child proved WIN inside the bounded probe goes last.

The only bounded probe that terminated early in these 140 rows is
`0-16-31-36`, proved WIN after 493,259 visited nodes with memo 487,509.  Plain
memo-ascending incorrectly puts that known WIN first.  Demoting proved WINs
moves the first LOSS for parent `0,31,36` from rank 2 to rank 1.

The exact random median is computed from

`P(R <= r) = 1 - C(m-r,l) / C(m,l)`

rather than from a Monte-Carlo simulation.  For the seven parents it is

`2, 6, 10, 10, 6, 1, 3`.

Against those exact medians:

- independent memo-desc: 0 better / 7 worse / 0 tie;
- memo-asc: 6 better / 1 worse / 0 tie;
- outcome-aware memo-asc: 6 better / 0 worse / 1 tie.

For the six non-tied parents of the outcome-aware rule, an exact two-sided sign
test gives `p = 0.03125`.

This p-value is **descriptive only** because the score direction was selected
post-hoc.  It must not be reported as a confirmatory significance result.

## Source-level correction: what `visited - memo` actually measures

A later audit of the 10x10 solver invalidated the earlier mechanistic label
"revisits / transposition convergence".

In `Solver::win`, the memo lookup occurs before `++st.visited`.  A memo hit
returns immediately and therefore does **not** increment `visited`.  Thus a
memo-hit/revisit cannot contribute +1 to `visited - memo`.

Moreover, `MultiDepthMemo100::get/put` are active only for depths 9 through 17.
Calls at depths below 9 or above 17 can be visited but are never retained by
`memo_.used()`.  For a four-stone child root, depths 4--8 are therefore an
important guaranteed source of `visited - memo`.

For completed searches, most visited cache-miss states at memoized depths are
inserted before returning.  Under a bounded/aborted probe there can also be a
small frontier contribution from calls that were visited but had not yet been
inserted when the probe stopped.  Consequently the difference is best treated
as a mixed **non-retained expansion count**, dominated structurally by
expansions outside the memoized depth window, not as a transposition-hit count.

This changes the interpretation but not the stored ordering: among unresolved
1M-visited candidates, smaller `memo` is still exactly the same ranking as
larger `visited - memo`.

## Revised hypothesis

A fresh hypothesis suitable for a new blind test is:

> Among 10x10 three-stone parents with multiple unresolved legal children,
> children whose fixed-budget independent search spends a larger fraction of
> its cache-miss expansions outside the depth-9..17 memoized window are more
> likely to be LOSS children.

For the present four-stone child roots, the most plausible component is the
amount of shallow expansion at depths 4--8.  One game-theoretic interpretation
is that LOSS children force the solver to exhaust more alternatives in the
shallow layers before deep memoized subproblems dominate.  This is a hypothesis,
not yet a demonstrated mechanism.

The next instrumentation should therefore record visited counts by depth, and
preferably memo insertions and memo hits by depth, rather than trying to infer
those quantities from one scalar `visited - memo`.

## Highest-value confirmatory test

Do **not** tune on the seven parents above.  Freeze the ordering rule now:

1. use fresh solver/memo per candidate;
2. same shrink/load/budget as the corrected run unless resource constraints
   require a separately declared experiment;
3. proved LOSS first, proved WIN last;
4. unresolved children sorted by `visited - memo` descending;
5. deterministic tie-break fixed before exact outcomes are inspected;
6. evaluate on new LOSS parents / batches not used to choose this direction;
7. compare first-LOSS rank against the exact random order-statistic baseline
   and solver-default ordering.

In parallel, instrument `visited_by_depth`, `memo_hits_by_depth`, and
`memo_puts_by_depth` on a separate diagnostic run.  These counters are for
mechanism interpretation and should not be used to retune the frozen blind
ordering before its confirmatory evaluation.

A second useful endpoint is candidate-level discrimination (LOSS vs WIN) using
`visited-memo`, evaluated by rank/AUC across each parent.  This uses all exact
children instead of only the first LOSS and can reveal whether the signal is
broad or driven by one unusually easy LOSS.

## Reproduction helper

`scripts/analyze_corrected_probe_direction.py` performs the stored-data join,
computes exact random medians, writes
`results/10x10/blind-probe-corrected/probe-direction-analysis.csv`, and reports
the sign-test summaries.

## Interpretation

The corrected result is therefore more interesting than simply "the 1M probe
failed".  The originally chosen sign failed badly, but the independent probe
appears to contain an opposite-direction structural signal.  What that scalar
signal means was initially misidentified: it is not a direct transposition
convergence measure.  The seven parents remain training/exploratory data for
the ordering hypothesis.  Only a new blind set can determine whether the
signal generalizes, while depth-resolved counters can separately test the new
shallow-expansion explanation.
