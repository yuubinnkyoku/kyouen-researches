"""Independent verification of the n=7 K=14 rigidity result.

For every one of the 16 maximal safe sets S:
  - verify S is safe (no forbidden quad inside)
  - verify S is maximal (every empty point has >= 1 blocker triple)
  - verify NO single-stone swap exists: for every empty v and every r in S,
    S - r + v must be unsafe
  - compute tau_S(v) exactly (min hitting set of blocker triples) by brute
    force and confirm the reported tau histogram and rho = min tau.

This is an independent re-derivation of the key claim
  forall S in M_7: rho(S) >= 2  (indeed = 2),
i.e. the 1-swap graph on 7x7 maximal sets has no edges.
