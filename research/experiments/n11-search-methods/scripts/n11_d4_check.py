"""Check the D4 solver's n=11 preliminary output for consistency.

The reported level_sizes_raw are the exact values measured by the 2-word
enumerator. If the orbit counts are a genuine 1/8 reduction, each raw level
should divide by (roughly) 8 -- exactly for levels where no position has a
non-trivial stabiliser, and less for small levels where the axis points force
some stabilisers.
