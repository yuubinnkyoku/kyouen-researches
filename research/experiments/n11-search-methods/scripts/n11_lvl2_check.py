"""Is the level-2 count really zero? Check against a known case.

The C++ run says every one of the C(N,2) pairs lies inside some forbidden
4-set, for every n from 6 to 11. If that were true the recorded level_sizes
would start [1, N, 0, ...] and the game could never reach 3 stones, which
contradicts the recorded n=6 sequence [1,36,630,7140,...].

So either the C++ pair set is wrong, or the recorded level-2 numbers mean
something else. n=6 has 36 points and 630 = C(36,2), i.e. *all* pairs: the
recorded level 2 is the set of 2-stone positions reachable by *playing*, and
a 2-stone position is legal iff no forbidden quad is completed *by the second
stone*, which is a different condition from "lies in some forbidden 4-set".

Resolve it by brute force: build a 2-stone position and test it directly with
the same predicate the game uses.
