# Screen all 20 D4-distinct second replies after the 11x11 center move v=60.
#
# Goal:
#   Root {60} is an AND node for the proposition "the original first player wins".
#   Proving center requires ALL 20 two-stone children {60,r} to be WIN (pn=0).
#   Refuting center requires ONE child to be LOSS (dn=0).
#
# Every reply is run in a FRESH PROCESS with a FRESH TT so difficulty is
# comparable and no sibling can inherit transposition work from another run.
#
# Usage:
#   BUDGET=300 MEMO=26 ./research/experiments/n11-search-methods/scripts/dfpn_center20.sh

# Move v=60 (the center) is played by the ORIGINAL FIRST PLAYER.
# After it, the ORIGINAL SECOND PLAYER to move, so each two-stone root
# {60,r} has 2 stones on the board => is_or(2) is true => OR node from
# the side-to-move's perspective, i.e. the ORIGINAL FIRST PLAYER is to
# move and is the maximizing side.
#
# Therefore at each child root:
#   WIN  = the original first player wins  (pn = 0, the proof side)
#   LOSS = the original second player wins (dn = 0, the disproof side)
# and at the parent {60} (1 stone, AND node for that same proposition):
#   proving the center needs ALL 20 children WIN
#   refuting the center needs ANY ONE child LOSS
#
# This is the parity relation that makes the aggregate verdict correct.
# The DFS cross-check on n=6/n=7 depends on the same inversion:
# odd-stone roots invert the reported side.

# OUTCOME STREAMS (verified 2026-09-30, do not "unify" these):
#   run_one() writes "[done] ... WIN/LOSS" to the LOG stream (L<<), and
#   writes the "# ... TIMEOUT" line to the CSV stream (C<<). They are
#   deliberately different streams, so a solved root shows up in the
#   log and an unsolved one shows up in the csv.
#
# Verified on a board that actually solves: n=6 root {30,1} finishes in
# 0 s and its log contains
#   [done] [roots{30,1}] WIN expansions=20462 root_pn=0 ...
# with an empty csv, while n=11 root {60,5} times out and puts
#   # [roots{60,5}] TIMEOUT reason=TIME_BUDGET ...
# in the csv. So: outcome from the log, timeout detail from the csv.
