# Shared-TT sweep over the center's 20 second replies.
#
# GOAL
#   Measure how much the 20 sibling proofs help each other when they
#   share one transposition table, versus solving them in isolation.
#   The single process behind --roots-csv already reuses one DfPn
#   instance across roots, so the TT survives from one root to the
#   next. All 20 roots are written into ONE csv, repeated ROUNDS
#   times, so the solver sweeps the same 20 roots several times over.
#
#   The "knowledge one root gained helps the other 19" question is
#   then answered by comparing, per round, each root's pn against the
#   same root's pn when it ran alone with a fresh TT
#   (research/experiments/n11-search-methods/reports/N11-DFPN-CENTER20.md).
#
# POLARITY (verified; see N11-DFPN-CENTER20.md)
#   Move 60 is the original first player's. After it the original
#   second player is to move, so a two-stone root {60,r} has
#   is_or(2)=true and the original first player is the maximizing
#   side. Child WIN = first player wins (pn=0), child LOSS = second
#   player wins (dn=0). At the AND node {60}, proving needs all 20
#   children WIN and refuting needs any one LOSS.
#
#   NOTE ON READING pn: a proof number is NOT a countdown of work
#   remaining. Unexpanded leaves start at (1,1) and the number
#   normally GROWS as the search refines; it drops to 0 only when the
#   proof line closes. So a smaller pn means "cheaper on the proof
#   side by the current estimate", never "6,660 steps from done", and
#   these numbers must not be extrapolated in time.
#
# USAGE
#   BUDGET=30 ROUNDS=3 MEMO=26 ORDER=fwd  ./dfpn_center20_sweep.sh
#   BUDGET=30 ROUNDS=3 MEMO=26 ORDER=rev  ./dfpn_center20_sweep.sh
#
#   BUDGET is SECONDS PER ROOT (not per sweep), so one sweep of 20
#   roots costs 20*BUDGET seconds and ROUNDS sweeps cost
#   20*BUDGET*ROUNDS.
#
# OUTPUT
#   $OUT/sweep-<order>.log   per-root [hb]/[done]/TIMEOUT lines
#   $OUT/sweep-<order>.csv   per-root outcome rows (shared TT)
#   $OUT/sweep-<order>.tsv   one tidy row per (round, reply)
