# Preregistration: F-E R-outside 4-stone holdout

Date: 2026-09-21
Base: `224f0dae89f95bfafa20290e872d96b9567dc6d7`
Status: **FROZEN BEFORE HOLDOUT OUTCOMES ARE COLLECTED OR INSPECTED**

## Question

Finding F-E was discovered inside the 70 four-stone subsets of the selected 8-stone LOSS route R = `{90,61,2,73,69,66,13,91}`. In that development set, LOSS states have larger `Sigma d` than WIN states. This experiment asks only whether the **direction** generalizes outside R:

`P(LOSS | high Sigma d) > P(LOSS | low Sigma d)`.

No claim about the R-development effect size is required for success.

## Clean universe

1. Enumerate all 10x10 four-stone states and reduce by the solver's D4 canonicalization.
2. Require the state itself to be legal/safe (it contains no dangerous four-point set).
3. Exclude the **entire D4 orbit** of every four-stone subset of R. Operationally, canonicalize all `C(8,4)=70` development states first, collect their canonical keys, and exclude those keys from the canonical universe. Merely testing whether the chosen canonical representative is literally a subset of the raw R is insufficient, because a D4-equivalent representative need not use point IDs from R.
4. Exclude every D4 orbit whose four-stone state/outcome occurs anywhere in git history at freeze base `224f0da`, including result CSV/JSON, certificates, probe/holdout/benchmark artifacts, docs containing explicit labelled states, and outcome caches. Exclusion is by canonical key, not raw spelling.
5. Selection code may use geometry and `Sigma d`, but MUST NOT read game outcome, solver memo, proof witness, visited count, or any descendant-derived feature.

The exclusion list and its source-path audit are frozen before solving any selected state.

## Geometry score

For each board point p, `d(p)` is the exact number of 10x10 dangerous quadruples (concyclic or collinear) containing p, computed by integer determinant as in `scripts/analysis/quadruple_stats.py`.

For state S, `Sigma d(S) = sum(d(p) for p in S)`.

No alternate geometry score may replace or be combined with this score on this holdout.

## Frozen sampling

After exclusions, sort the clean canonical universe by the tuple `(Sigma d, canonical_state)`. Let `N` be its size and `q = floor(N/5)`. Define the strata by exact Python-style half-open slices of that sorted list:

- LOW: `sorted_states[0:q]`
- MID: `sorted_states[floor(2*N/5):floor(3*N/5)]`
- HIGH: `sorted_states[N-q:N]`

Thus LOW and HIGH each contain exactly `floor(N/5)` states; MID uses the fixed 40%-to-60% rank interval. No alternate percentile convention or rounding rule is permitted.

`canonical_state` has one frozen textual serialization everywhere selection or hashing depends on it: sort the four canonical point IDs numerically ascending, encode each as unsigned ASCII decimal with no leading zeros, and join them with a single ASCII comma. There are no brackets, spaces, quotes, or trailing newline. Example: the state with point IDs 4, 9, 33, 57 serializes exactly as `4,9,33,57`.

Within each stratum rank candidates by ascending SHA-256 digest interpreted lexicographically as its 64-character lowercase hexadecimal representation. The hashed byte string is exactly UTF-8/ASCII

`kyouen-10x10-f-e-r-outside-v1-20260921:` + `canonical_state`

with no BOM, NUL, whitespace, or newline before or after it. Select the first 12 states per stratum: 36 states total. Because `(Sigma d, canonical_state)` totally orders the pre-slice universe and SHA-256 of the frozen serialization orders candidates within a stratum, no implementation-dependent tie handling remains. No replacement or state dropping is allowed after the 36-state manifest is frozen, except a solver/infrastructure failure that prevents an exact result; every such failure remains in the report and is not replaced.

Before exact solving, commit:

- this preregistration;
- complete canonical exclusion list plus source audit;
- clean-universe counts and stratum boundaries;
- the 36-state sampling manifest containing raw/canonical state, stratum, `Sigma d`, and selection hash;
- solver source commit/digest and exact-run protocol.

## Exact solving

Use the repository's validated 10x10 exact solver with a fresh process and fresh memo for each state. Use the same fixed solver configuration for all 36 states. Exact classification has no visited-node budget; resource/time failures are censored failures, not outcomes and not reasons to substitute another state.

Raw solver output must be committed before aggregate endpoint analysis.

## Primary endpoint

Primary statistic:

`Delta = LOSS_rate(HIGH) - LOSS_rate(LOW)`.

Success criterion: `Delta > 0`.

Report the raw 2x2 HIGH/LOW counts and an exact two-sided Fisher test as descriptive uncertainty. The sign criterion, not p<0.05, is the preregistered success rule because n=24 for the primary contrast is intentionally a small confirmatory screen.

If either HIGH or LOW has an unsolved/censored state, primary status is `INCOMPLETE`; do not silently analyze only completed states as the confirmatory endpoint.

## Secondary endpoints

On all 36 completed states, report without changing the primary decision:

1. AUC for `Sigma d` discriminating LOSS from WIN (LOSS is positive).
2. Rank-biserial effect size.
3. Mean and median `Sigma d` by outcome.
4. Spearman association between `Sigma d` and binary LOSS label.
5. LOW/MID/HIGH LOSS counts and rates.
6. Exact conditional label-randomization statistic for the observed number of LOSS labels, clearly marked descriptive because sampled states are not an iid population sample.
7. Exact visited and wall-time distributions by stratum/outcome as exploratory solver-cost diagnostics only.

## Interpretation gates

- `Delta > 0`: F-E's **direction** survives a clean R-outside holdout; R-specific combinatorics alone no longer explain the observation.
- `Delta = 0`: no directional replication.
- `Delta < 0`: directional contradiction on this holdout.
- The cohort MUST NOT be enlarged, strata changed, or seed changed after labels are inspected. Any revised hypothesis requires a new holdout.
- Because selection deliberately samples score extremes, the observed LOSS rates are not estimates of the unconditional prevalence of LOSS among all four-stone states.

## Non-claims

This experiment does not establish causality of `Sigma d`, does not estimate the population LOSS rate, does not validate a move-order heuristic, and does not turn the within-R label-randomization p-value into a population significance claim.
